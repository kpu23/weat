      2. Update the database (fooditems) and set the imgPath attribute to “/public/images/<restaurant name>/<image name>”
   1. For a restaurant:
      1. Add an image to the “/public/images” folder
      2. Update the database (restaurants) and set the imgPath attribute to “/public/images/<image name>”
How to run:
1. Install Node and NPM (https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Open CMD line 
3. Run <npm install -g bower> to install bower on your machine
4. Run <npm install -g nodemon> to install nodemon on your machine
5. Clone the github repository (instructions for cloning at https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/).
6. Github repo can be found at https://github.com/kpu23/weat
7. Navigate to the checked out directory on the CMD line
8. Run <npm install> 
9. Run <bower install> 
10. Run <nodemon> to build the project (make sure you’re in project directory still)
11. Nodemon will recompile source files as they change and refresh the server
12. Navigate to localhost:3000 in your browser and the weat homepage should appear
                Note 1: text between carrots (e.g. <text>) are verbatim CMD line commands
Note 2: without data, the website will have very little functionality. At the bottom of this document there are instructions to populate the database with test data.
Explanation of Basic Architecture:
        Weat is a web-based online ordering system. It is based on the MEAN stack, meaning we run MongoDB, Express.js, front-end javascript (knockout.js), and Node.js. MongoDB is the database, Express.js is a back-end javascript framework for communication with the server, knockout.js is a front-end javascript framework (that we are using instead of Angular, the “A” in “MEAN”), and Node.js runs a server and includes package management capabilities.
Database Script:
To run this database script:
1. Open the command line
2. Type <mongo> to enter mongo shell
3. Type <use weat> to access the correct db (this will create the db if it’s the first time)
4. Open any text viewer file and locate the file “03-11_1_PopulateMongoDatabase.txt” in the root directory of the weat source code
5. Copy the entire script into the command line and run it 
6. Type <show collections;> to verify the script ran successfully.                          
7. Type <exit> to quit the mongo shell. You should now be able to use the website’s full functionality.
